# Tailwind Migration Plan (Incremental)

Purpose: Replace Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS across the frontend safely and incrementally, preserving UX while improving performance and consistency.

## Goals
- Consolidate on Tailwind CSS utilities and design tokens
- Remove Bootstrap CSS/JS and avoid double-styling
- Preserve existing UX and accessibility

## Non‑Goals
- Large visual redesigns (beyond minor polish)
- Introducing a heavy component framework (use headless patterns)

## Risks & Mitigations
- Visual regressions → Pilot per page, visual checklists, review links
- Dynamic classes purged by Tailwind → Use class maps and safelist
- Bootstrap JS reliance → Replace with Angular/CDK or headless patterns

---

## Phase 0 — Preflight (Day 0)
1) Confirm Tailwind integration is active
   - tailwind.config.js: content includes `./src/**/*.{html,ts}`
   - postcss.config.js includes tailwind and autoprefixer
2) Agree on tokens
   - Extend Tailwind theme to match current brand colors, spacing, radius, shadows
3) Create a safelist for dynamic class patterns (status badges, alerts)
4) Decide pilot page(s)
   - Start with `pc-build-template-editor`, then `pc-list`, `pc-components`

Acceptance criteria
- App builds successfully; no purge issues on pilot routes

---

## Phase 1 — Bridge Layer (Day 1)
1) Add tw-bridge.css
   - Re-implement common Bootstrap class names with Tailwind via `@apply`
   - Scope: buttons, badges, cards, form controls, table basics, simple grid helpers
2) Import bridge once (global styles)
3) Add CI guard to prevent new Bootstrap usage
   - Grep for `class=\".*\b(btn|badge|card|table|row|col-).*\"` in newly changed files

Acceptance criteria
- App visually unchanged using bridge + Tailwind utilities
- New diffs avoid new Bootstrap class usage

---

## Phase 2 — Shared Tailwind Components (Days 2–3)
1) Create minimal shared primitives (Angular components or directives):
   - Button, Badge, Card, FormControl, Table, Alert (headless)
2) Centralize status → class maps (Active, Maintenance, Retired…)
3) Document usage examples in README snippets

Acceptance criteria
- Pilot page compiles with shared primitives
- Status classes come from a single mapping

---

## Phase 3 — Page‑by‑Page Migration (Rolling)
Migration order (highest traffic first):
1) PC Build Template Editor (`src/app/pc/pc-build-template-editor.*`)
2) PC List (`src/app/pc/pc-list.*`)
3) PC Components (`src/app/pc/pc-components.*`)
4) Home dashboard widgets that link to PC pages
5) Remaining feature pages (stocks, approvals, analytics, profile)

For each page
- Replace layout (grid/spacing) with Tailwind utilities
- Replace buttons/badges/cards/forms/tables with Tailwind or shared primitives
- Remove page-level Bootstrap classes (bridge still present globally)
- Map dynamic classes to static strings in TS (avoid runtime construction)
- Visual QA: header, forms, tables, alerts, empty/loading states

Definition of done per page
- No Bootstrap classes remain in the page’s HTML/CSS
- No layout/spacing regressions on mobile/desktop
- Keyboard and screen reader flows intact

---

## Phase 4 — Remove Bootstrap (Final Cut)
1) Verify: zero Bootstrap classes used across `src` (scripted grep)
2) Remove Bootstrap CSS/JS includes from `angular.json` and any imports
3) Remove tw-bridge.css
4) Re‑build and run smoke tests; fix residual spacing/typography issues

Acceptance criteria
- Build succeeds without Bootstrap
- Visual QA pass on top 5 flows

---

## Phase 5 — Polish & Hardening
1) Performance
   - Confirm Tailwind purge is active; analyze CSS bundle size
2) Accessibility
   - Verify color contrast on status badges and buttons
   - Focus states visible; alerts announced with role
3) Theming (optional)
   - Extract theme tokens; consider dark mode toggle

---

## Operational Details
- Dynamic classes
  - Use TS maps (e.g., status → Tailwind class string)
  - Add `safelist` in tailwind.config.js for any unavoidable variants
- Modals/Dropdowns/Tooltips
  - Prefer Angular/CDK and headless patterns instead of Bootstrap JS
- CI Guards
  - Grep-based check to fail on new Bootstrap class additions

---

## Task Breakdown & Estimates
- Phase 0–1: 0.5–1 day
- Phase 2: 1–2 days (create primitives + docs)
- Phase 3: 2–4 days (3 main pages) + 1–2 days remaining pages
- Phase 4–5: 0.5–1 day

---

## Rollback Plan
- If critical issues appear during Phase 3, re-enable Bootstrap includes and keep bridge until fixed
- Keep page migrations atomic; revert single-page diffs without affecting others

---

## Tracking Checklist
